#### for all the sample scripts provided in this course.       #######
#### We simulate three datasets: occupancy records for multiple ######
#### sites over multiple years. This will involve repeat surveys #####
###  within a primary season when the populations are assumed to #####
###  be closed, with the population assumed to be open between  #####
#### primary seasons. This is the classic ROBUST DESIGN.         #####
### We will use a robust design to also simulate sampling over a #####
### subset of these sites using repeated counts. Lastly, another ####
### smaller subset of sites will be simulated to be sampled using ####
### capture-recapture methods, again following a robust design.   #####
####                                                             ##### 
### We link these demographic parameters (occupancy, abundance,   ###
### site persistence and extinction, survival) to predictors    ####
### We also link detection to predictors.                         ####

#### Simulating data #################
# Our study species is the Piute ground squirrel, Spermophilus    # 
# mollis. Ground squirrels are widely distributed in sagebrush steppe #
# habitats of the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau. #
# Their abundance is influenced by drought, low temperatures when #
# they emerge from hibernation in Feb and high temperatures in April-May #

# Think of this simulation as designing your field study. We first #
# need to define how many sites to sample, how many repeat surveys #
# each primary season (i.e.,season when the population is assumed #
# to be closed) and how many primary seasons (1 or more)?         #
# Let's start defining these:
# Number of years we will run the study (primary seasons):
# study will run from 2007 to 2018. Define year range:
yrrange <- 2007:2018
# create column names for each year
yrnames <- paste( "yr", yrrange, sep = "")
#number of primary seasons:
T <- length( yrrange )
#create a dataframe of years sampled
yrdf <- data.frame( year = yrrange, yearname = yrnames )

# Number of repeat surveys each season:
J <- 3
#Note that at least 3 surveys are recommended when detection is >0.5
# Mackenzie and Royle (2005) J. App. Ecol. 42: 1105-1114.

# Number of sites we visit to search for presence:
Io <- 100
# Number of sites we visit to count individuals observed, without marking them:
Ic <- 50
# Number of sites we visit to trap and mark individuals:
Im <- 20
# define the radius (in m) of our effective sampling area
buf <- 200

# Start by randomly selecting sites to sample:
# choose sites inside NCA, note some may be too close to be independent so #
# we start with a bigger selection than what we need
sites <- st_sample( NCA, size = Io*2, exact = TRUE )
#calculate distances between sites

# convert site location to spatial object
